# learning_algorithms

Algorithms are sequence of steps to solve a clearly defined problem. Every program is an algorithm. Every program can consist of many smaller algorithms. 

What is the best possible solution to a given problem? Often the best possible solution is the one that has the best performance, so it takes the least amount of time.
